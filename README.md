## Overview
This challenge went slightly better than my first. I used the figma design details to set size requirements, however I struggled still struggled to get the desired responsiveness. I welcome any feedback on how to achieve this.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
I started with HTML code to build the page. Then I styled with CSS using Flexbox containers for the elements. I used "vw" units for the parent container, "card-container" and the img flex child. I also used @media queries to add the hover color and pointer and adjust sizing. I ran into trouble with the in-between sizes (above 400px to 1000px). I tried adding min-max size attributes to the @media queries, but that caused the less than 400px size to overflow the container. Not sure why that occurred, so I removed these additional size parameters.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- 


### What I learned

Practice is essential and I will continue to work on challenges to hone my skills. I learned to use flexbox and @media queries to achieve responsive page display. I will seek out additional practice on this, as my design is far from perfect and I welcome any feedback anyone is willing to share.



### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

The Figma Design files were helpful for size parameters. I also used these sites:
Free Code Camp helped me to gain a general understanding of HTML, CSS and in particular flexbox use: https://www.freecodecamp.org/
W3 Schools is a great reference for both HTML and CSS: https://www.w3schools.com/
